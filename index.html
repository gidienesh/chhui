            <p class="description">
                From 5-star luxury lodges to the boutique Ranch House Bistro, an 18,000-acre wildlife sanctuary and
                prime real estate, Oserian Two Lakes has it all. The Zwager family has created a tourism venture
                consisting of a luxury safari lodge, Chui Lodge & a boutique lake side restaurant, Ranch House Bistro.
                These provide the opportunity for people to stay and explore the Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary and
                experience for themselves conservation in practice. Funds raised through tourism are reinvested into the
                Oserian Two Lakes conservation programs. Around an hour and a half drive from Nairobi, Oserengoni
                Wildlife Sanctuary is a privately owned, 18,000 acre, flora and fauna paradise. It is home to a
                diversity of wildlife that includes: Leopard, Grevy’s Zebra, Masai Giraffe, Bat-eared fox, Buffalo,
                Hyena, Aardvark and many other plains game. The wildlife sanctuary and surrounding lakeshore is host to
                over 400 bird species such as, African Fish Eagle, Narina Trogon, Grey-crested Helmet-shrike,
                Rufous-crowned Roller, Spotted Eagle-Owl and Somali Ostrich. By staying at either Chui Lodge or Kiangazi
                House, you can enjoy all of this diverse and unique wildlife from one of our open or closed safari 4X4
                land cruisers. With the expert knowledge of our friendly and professional guides, you will find hours
                will pass by like minutes. Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the central part of the Great
                Rift Valley in Kenya, west of the Aberdare ranges and north east of the Mau escarpment. It borders both
                Lake Naivasha and Lake Oloidien - the highest lakes along the floor of the rift Valley. The topography
                of the land comprises the elevated Maiella ridge that raises 7,748 ft. above sea level to the lower
                plains on the East that stretch to the shores of the Lakes Oloidien and Naivasha at 6,200fts above sea
                level. The Great Rift Valley is a vast geographical and geological feature, approximately 6,000
                kilometers (3,700 miles) in length, which runs from northern Syria to central Mozambique. The rift
                valley varies in width from thirty to one hundred kilometers, and in depth from a few hundred to several
                thousand meters. This massive geological split runs through the heart of East Africa and the Kenyan
                section of the Rift Valley is home to eight lakes. Lakes Turkana, Logipi, Bogoria, Nakuru, Elementaita
                and Magadi are all alkaline lakes and are famous for the large flocks of Flamingos that feed on
                crustaceans. The only freshwater lakes are Baringo and Naivasha.

                last-minute work email you forgot to send. Off the courtyard is a laundry room with washing machine for

                a perfect spot for a lunch in the shade of the trees or an afternoon tea. Taking time out to relax under

                The wildlife sanctuary surrounding Chui Lodge was created in the mid 1990’s with the sole purpose of
                giving the resident wildlife a place of safety and refuge. Over 18, 000 acres is surrounded by an
                electrified fence, as much to keep illegal cattle grazers out as it is to keep the wildlife from

                of wildlife corridors which ensures constant movement throughout the localized eco-system. Since the
                creation of the sanctuary and the wildlife corridors the number of wildlife, specifically species such
                as leopard and giraffe, persecuted by the villages in the past, has stabilized and increased to
                sustainable levels. Whilst lions do occasionally visit, such as George the lion who was a full time
                resident for more than 5 years, there is a pressing need to “predator proof” the fence surround the
                Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary and to turn our sporadic predator presence into a full time programme.
                This will allow natural control of the ever-increasing numbers of certain herbivore species within the
                sanctuary. Within the sanctuary and game corridors we have over 50 mammal species, some of these
                include, Leopard, Topi, Grevy’s zebra, Impala, Serval cat, Warthog, and Lesser Galago. Naivasha is a
                main stop for many migratory birds, and plays a huge role in hosting the breeding grounds for numerous
                species. All year round we have over 400 species of birds that thrive in the different ecosystems that
                are part of Oserengoni Wildlife Sanctuary. To say the least we are a birders paradise, some common
                sightings are Klaas’s Cuckoo, Long-crested Eagle, Spectacled Weaver and Black-backed Puffback.
